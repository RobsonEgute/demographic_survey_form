# Project Description: React-Based Demographic Data Capture for Subscription or Survey

## Overview
This project involves building a **React-based web application** to capture demographic data from users during a subscription onboarding flow or survey experience. The application will provide a responsive, accessible, and user-friendly interface while ensuring secure handling of sensitive demographic information.

## Objectives
- Build a modern, reusable React UI for demographic data collection
- Ensure smooth user experience across desktop and mobile devices
- Enable scalable data handling for surveys and subscriptions
- Support analytics, segmentation, and reporting needs
- Maintain privacy, security, and regulatory compliance

## Technology Stack
- **Frontend:** React (with Hooks and Functional Components)
- **State Management:** React Context API or Redux (optional)
- **Form Handling:** Controlled components / React Hook Form / Formik
- **Validation:** Client-side validation with real-time feedback
- **Styling:** CSS Modules, Tailwind CSS, or Material UI
- **Backend Integration:** REST or GraphQL APIs
- **Deployment:** Vercel, Netlify, or cloud-based hosting

## Key Features
- Modular React components for each demographic field
- Dynamic form rendering based on survey or subscription type
- Progressive profiling to reduce user friction
- Client-side validation and error handling
- Accessible design following WCAG guidelines
- Mobile-first, responsive layout

## Demographic Data Collected
The application will support configurable demographic fields, including:
- Age or age range
- Gender identity
- Geographic location (country, region, city)
- Education level
- Employment status or industry
- Income range (optional)
- Preferred language
- Household or marital status (optional)

## User Flow
1. User initiates subscription or survey
2. React form loads demographic questions dynamically
3. User inputs data with real-time validation feedback
4. Data is reviewed and submitted securely
5. Confirmation or next-step screen is displayed

## Data Handling & Storage
- Data is submitted via secure API endpoints
- Sensitive fields are encrypted in transit
- Backend services store and process data securely
- Supports anonymization or aggregation for analytics

## Privacy and Compliance
- Explicit consent captured via React form controls
- Clear disclosure of data usage and purpose
- Compliance with regulations such as GDPR and CCPA
- Ability for users to update or delete their data

## Success Metrics
- Form completion rate
- Drop-off rate per demographic step
- Data accuracy and validation error rate
- Performance and load time metrics
- User satisfaction feedback

## Future Enhancements
- Multi-language support using i18n libraries
- Admin dashboard for managing demographic fields
- Integration with analytics platforms
- A/B testing for form optimization
